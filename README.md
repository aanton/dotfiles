```bash
# Create symlinks
./install.sh create_symlinks

# Create local configuration files
./install.sh create_local_configs

# Configure scripts behaviours
export DISABLE_APT_UPDATE=true
export FORCE_INSTALLATION=true

# Install tools
./install.sh install_tools

# Install fonts
./install.sh install_fonts

# Install desktop tools (only in GUI environments)
# Confirmation is required for some tools depending on the FORCE_INSTALLATION environment variable
./install.sh install_desktop_tools
